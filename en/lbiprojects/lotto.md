## Project description

Long term partnership for the internet projects

The National Lottery was looking for a partner to whom they could assign the maintenance of their main sites, www.lotto.be and www.euromillions.be.

In 2006, LBi has taken on the full maintenance of the existing site. Next to the regular maintenace, there are many other extra developments carried out for the National Lottery, from developing a simple form to setting up a complete web application to do opt-in marketing.

Since the end of 2007, LBi is developing the new website. For this project Tridion is used as CMS combined with numerous custom applications specificly developed for the National Lottery. The main difference is also that a lot of attention is spent on the performance of the system. With three front-end servers and with a maximum on statistic pages the system is capable to intercept the more heavy actions which occur regularly on the webservers (especially with the special drawings with an extra large jack-pot).

In January 2009, the brand new version of the site was released.
