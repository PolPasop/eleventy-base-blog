### Project description

This project involves managing the transition of the Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (JRC) from the Connected intranet platform to Microsoft 365 (M365). The JRC is the European Commission's science and knowledge service, with over 2,700 staff members across six sites. The goal is to streamline collaboration by integrating various intranet and collaborative tools into a unified M365 platform, enhancing open knowledge sharing and staff engagement. As part of this transition, content from the current Connected platform will migrate to M365 tools such as Teams, SharePoint Online, and Yammer. The JRC aims to create a more user-friendly collaboration environment while contributing to strategic EU policymaking efforts. The project entails coordination, needs assessment, content migration, and architectural design, in partnership with DG DIGIT and DG HR.
