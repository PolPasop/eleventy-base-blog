## Project description

The European Commission's Corporate Portal (CP), known as My IntraComm, is a personalised intranet platform and a portal to information and services used by all EC employees. It is the result of a strategic, multi-year project to modernise the way staff works under a simplified administration and a revised IT governance structure. This information system is meant to provide a single point of access to a wide range of e-services in different domains, such as internal information, administrative matters, collaborative workspaces, or on-line content sharing and management across the Institution. 

The Corporate Portal must be continuously supported, maintained and further developed, based on technological changes and new requirements, which encompass the gradual inclusion of intranet resources from other content suppliers within the Commission, further development of collaboration services and social features, integration with other information systems, optimisation of resource utilisation, infrastructural updates, and system upgrades.

## Responsabilities

- Provide technical expertise to the CP team and internal customers on content migration to SharePoint 2013, the platforms on which the CP architecture is based. 
- Assist the Corporate Portal's infrastructure and web design teams with the transition of graphical and content components through the upgrade. 
- Provide support and assistance, from a web design perspective, to individual DG web teams as their CP-hosted web sites are transitioned to the SharePoint 2013 platform. 
- Provide assistance with the implementation and documentation of graphical and related technical changes required within the CP environment. 
- Provide assistance and advice in creating, developing, maintaining and upgrading intranet and collaboration sites and resources on the CP platform. 
- Proactively suggest improvements to the CP environments with a focus on solution usability and user experience.
