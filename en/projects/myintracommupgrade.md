## Project description

The European Commission's Corporate Portal (CP), known as My IntraComm, is a personalised portal to information and services used by all EC employees. It is the result of a strategic, multi-year project to modernise the way staff works under a simplified administration and a revised IT governance structure.



This information system is meant to provide a single point of access to a wide range of e-services in different domains, in the form of a simple interface which staff can personalise to meet their specific needs.



The Corporate Portal must be maintained and further developed, based on technological changes and new requirements, which encompass the gradual inclusion of intranet resources from other content suppliers within the Commission, further development of Collaboration services and social features, optimisation of resource utilisation, infrastructural updates, and system upgrades.



The contractor will be part of the Corporate Portal's Support and Migration team, and work closely with the internal web masters and web designers.

## Responsabilities


- Provide technical expertise to the CP team on content migration from MOSS 2007 to SharePoint 2010, the platforms on which the CP architecture is based.
- Assist the Corporate Portal's infrastructure and web design teams with the transition of graphical and content components through the upgrade.
- Provide support and assistance, from a web design perspective, to individual DG web teams as their CP-hosted web sites are transitioned to the SharePoint platform.
- Provide assistance with the implementation and documentation of graphical and related technical changes required within the CP environment.
