## Project description

BNP Paribas Fortis is Belgium’s largest bank and the result of the acquisition of Fortis bank by BNP Paribas Group, the largest company in financial asset management worldwide. The activity is focused on three client segments: retail clients, companies and entrepreneurs, and private banking.  

With its multi-channel interactive marketing solution, Selligent offers a perfect answer to these digital changes requiring an integrated and consistent customer experience throughout all client contacts. A centralized data model is key to succeed in this.

Selligent Interactive Marketing has been integrated in all channels where customers can request information, open accounts or add new services the bank offers. These data are collected via internet and automatically passed on to the contact centre. They are also added to the other applications of the bank. The application further steers all e-mails, so it can be used by local branch managers to send secure and personalized e-mails to their customers, based on a centralized system to ensure consistency. Finally, all web forms are managed by Selligent Interactive Marketing”.
