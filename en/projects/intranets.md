## Project description

The European Commission's Corporate Portal (CP), known as My IntraComm, is a personalised intranet platform and a portal to information and services used by all EC employees. It is the result of a strategic, multi-year project to modernise the way staff works under a simplified administration and a revised IT governance structure. This information system is meant to provide a single point of access to a wide range of e-services in different domains, such as internal information, administrative matters, collaborative workspaces, or on-line content sharing and management across the Institution.

The Corporate Portal must be continuously supported, maintained and further developed, based on technological changes and new requirements, which encompass the gradual inclusion of intranet resources from other content suppliers within the Commission, further development of collaboration services and social features, integration with other information systems, optimisation of resource utilisation, infrastructural updates, and system upgrades.
